I need a custom widget that I will use on a custom type field on a record producer. The idea is there is a field on the record producer "job_code". If no job code is selected the widget should show something like "Please select a job code". Once one is chosen, a lookup should be made to the custom table "x_banun_bunow_si_0_authority_limits". THis table also has a field "job_code" that can be used to lookup. It should also check that the active field is true for the authority limits. If it finds NO authority limits matching the job code and that are active a message should appear saying something like "job code X does not have any existing authority limits". If it DOES find limits a nice view should appear, possibly a table view as there might be multiple rows. The fields it needs to pull back are:
job_code
job_code.job_description
(The next fields are all the authority limits, half are credit and half are non-credit. I'm not sure if there is a way in the view to seperate out them so it's easier to read but here are the values)
credit limits:
overdraft_external_accounts
overdraft_internal_accounts
unavailable_funds_external_accounts
unavailable_funds_internal_accounts

non-credit limits:
disbursement_ach
disbursement_wire_transfer_external
disbursement_wire_transfer_internal
disbursement_official_checks_external
disbursement_official_checks_internal
check_cashing_on_us
check_cashing_not_on_us
remote_deposit
treasury_solutions_company_wire_limits
fx_wire_limits

If the job code field on the record changes this view should be updated to show the approprate message or new authority limits that it found.
