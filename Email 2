Remove the word Job Function and sticky left justify it and also make the color of that row #EBF1DE
Job titles are not working make sure to use job_code.job_description
make the row with "Disbursment/checkcashing/ect" this color #00B0F0
Make the ach/wire transfer/ect column this color: #C5D9F1
Then that light yellow color you are using to highlight, ONLY highlight the column that has changed or is new. Also use that color to highlight the job title and job code that is changing, also have you have (requested) under the job title do that for job code too. Also bold the values that are changing in addition to the yellow highloight.
